# Simulator Tutorial 

This simulator supports two types of simulation scenarios. The first scenario operates in a non-IID (Non-Independent and Identically Distributed) data environment, where data is distributed across clients in a heterogeneous manner. The second scenario extends this further by incorporating both non-IID and heterogeneous data settings, where each client is assigned entirely different datasets, ensuring an even greater diversity in data distribution.

In the first scenario, the simulation uses the file `CIDS-Sim_Non-IID.ipynb` in folder `Non-IID`. In the second scenario the simulation is conducted using the file `CIDS-Sim_Non-IID_Heterogeneous.ipynb` in folder `Heterogeneous`. Please open Each folder to read the details about each simulation scenario.
