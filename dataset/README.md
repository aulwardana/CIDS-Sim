# Dataset Description

The default dataset used in this research is CoAt-Set. The CoAt-Set dataset is a transformed, specialized dataset designed to support collaborative anomaly detection within Collaborative Intrusion Detection Systems (CIDS). This dataset extract coordinated attack behaviors from established sources like CIC-ToN-IoT, CIC-IDS2017, CIC-UNSW-NB15, CSE-CIC-IDS2018, CIC-BoT-IoT, Distrinet-CIC-IDS2017, and NF-UQ-NIDS, refining these raw datasets into a format specifically designed for collaborative anomaly detection. CoAt-Set highlights coordinated attack situations, such as widespread, stealthy scanning, worm outbreaks, and distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, all of which mirror high-impact, realistic threats that are frequently found in todayâ€™s complex networks.

# Dataset Setup

Please download the dataset [here](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/28tmfg3rzb/2) and put all the files in the dataset folder. The details of the dataset processing can be seen in this [publication](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/28tmfg3rzb/2).

# Dataset Alternative

You can also used multi-dataset with same feature from NetFlow Dataset. The dataset can be donloaded [here](https://staff.itee.uq.edu.au/marius/NIDS_datasets/). Please put the dataset in dataset folder. You need to convert the dataset in parquet files by your self or download the dataset with parquet files from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/dhoogla/datasets).
